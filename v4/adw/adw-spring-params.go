// Physical parameters of a spring for [class@SpringAnimation].
//
// Any spring can be described by three parameters: mass, stiffness and damping.
//
// An undamped spring will produce an oscillatory motion which will go on
// forever.
//
// The frequency and amplitude of the oscillations will be determined by the
// stiffness (how "strong" the spring is) and its mass (how much "inertia" it
// has).
//
// If damping is larger than 0, the amplitude of that oscillating motion will
// exponientally decrease over time. If that damping is strong enough that the
// spring can't complete a full oscillation, it's called an overdamped spring.
//
// If we the spring can oscillate, it's called an underdamped spring.
//
// The value between these two behaviors is called critical damping; a
// critically damped spring will comes to rest in the minimum possible time
// without producing oscillations.
//
// The damping can be replaced by damping ratio, which produces the following
// springs:
//
// * 0: an undamped spring.
// * Between 0 and 1: an underdamped spring.
// * 1: a critically damped spring.
// * Larger than 1: an overdamped spring.
//
// As such
