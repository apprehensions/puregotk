// `GskTransform` is an object to describe transform matrices.
//
// Unlike `graphene_matrix_t`, `GskTransform` retains the steps in how
// a transform was constructed, and allows inspecting them. It is modeled
// after the way CSS describes transforms.
//
// `GskTransform` objects are immutable and cannot be changed after creation.
// This means code can safely expose them as properties of objects without
// having to worry about others changing them.
