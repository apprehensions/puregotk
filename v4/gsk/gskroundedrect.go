package gsk

// A rectangular region with rounded corners.
//
// Application code should normalize rectangles using
// [method@Gsk.RoundedRect.normalize]; this function will ensure that
// the bounds of the rectangle are normalized and ensure that the corner
// values are positive and the corners do not overlap.
//
// All functions taking a `GskRoundedRect` as an argument will internally
// operate on a normalized copy; all functions returning a `GskRoundedRect`
// will always return a normalized one.
//
// The algorithm used for normalizing corner sizes is described in
// [the CSS specification](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-backgrounds-3/#border-radius).
