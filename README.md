# Puregotk

> **_NOTE:_**  This library is currently expiremental and needs thorough testing. Some APIs might be incorrectly exposed

Autogenerated GTK4+Adwaita bindings for Go leveraging [purego](https://github.com/ebitengine/purego)

# Motivation
I created this library because I found that alternative libraries using Cgo had much too slow compilation speed. For my laptop around 15 minutes to build a simple example for [gotk3](https://github.com/gotk3/gotk3) and also [gotk4](https://github.com/diamondburned/gotk4).
This is not a fault for these libraries as CGo compilation is just inherently slow in Go. In this project I want to test a new approach by levering purego which allows you to load libraries using dlopen without needing cgo.

Compilation speed currently is around 40 seconds for me on basic examples.

## Advantages

No Cgo needed, thus:
* Easy cross compilation
* No C toolchain needed
* Much faster compile times than alternatives like [gotk3](https://github.com/gotk3/gotk3) & [gotk4](https://github.com/diamondburned/gotk4)
  
## Disadvantages

Limitations of this library as compared to the alternatives using cgo:
* Some APIs are not possible due to purego not currently supporting struct arguments (that are not pointers)
* Currently only support for x86, for ARM I need to figure out how to get callbacks working in purego and contribute to purego

# Planned features
In order of priority:
* General code cleanup
* ARM support
* Support for OS other than Linux (I only test on Linux currently)
* GTK 3 support

# Basic example

```go
package main

import (
	"os"
	"github.com/jwijenbergh/puregotk/v4/gtk"
	"github.com/jwijenbergh/puregotk/v4/gio"
)

func main() {
	app := gtk.NewApplication("com.github.jwijenbergh.puregotk.gtk4.hello", gio.GApplicationFlagsNoneValue)
	defer app.Unref()
	app.ConnectActivate(func (_ gio.Application) {
		activate(app)
	})

	if code := app.Run(len(os.Args), os.Args); code > 0 {
		os.Exit(code)
	}
}

func activate(app gtk.Application) {
	var window gtk.ApplicationWindow
	gtk.NewApplicationWindow(app).Cast(&window)
	window.SetTitle("purego")
	window.SetChild(gtk.NewLabel("Hello, World!"))
	window.SetDefaultSize(500, 500)
	window.Show()
}
```

Save this to a main.go and then build & run with

```bash
CGO_ENABLED=0 go run main.go
```

> **_NOTE:_**  Passing CGO_ENABLED=0 is currently required

# Generating the library
This library is automatically generated by reading GIR files.

To generate the library, run:

```bash
./gen.sh
```

In the root of the project. This needs:

- Go >= 1.20
- [goimports](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/tools/cmd/goimports)
